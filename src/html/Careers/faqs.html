            What documents do I need to provide to apply for a loan?
          </h3>
          <p class="faqs__item-text">
            The documents required for a loan application may vary depending on
            the type of loan you are applying for. Generally, you will need to
            provide identification documents (such as a passport or driver's
            license), proof of income (such as pay stubs or tax returns), and
            information about the collateral (if applicable). Our loan officers
            will guide you through the specific requirements during the
            application process.
